# Advent of Code 2022

## About

These are my solutions to the Advent of Code 2022. This year I'm attempting to code the solutions in Rust to punish myself. I still dislike Rust.

## What is Advent of Code?

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an Advent calendar of small programming 
puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any 
programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, 
company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge 
each other.
